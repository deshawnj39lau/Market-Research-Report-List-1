<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horizontal Vortex Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Vortex Pump</li><li>Open Vortex Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The horizontal vortex pump market includes two main types: closed vortex pumps and open vortex pumps. Closed vortex pumps are designed with a casing that fully encloses the impeller, creating a vortex effect to move fluid efficiently, making them ideal for handling large volumes of liquids with minimal turbulence. Open vortex pumps, in contrast, feature an exposed impeller design that allows for greater flow passage, making them suitable for applications with suspended solids or less stringent pressure requirements. Both types cater to diverse industrial needs.</p></p>
